    " - Based on the school budgets, there is an inverse correlation between school spend per student and results. This is confirmed in the list of 5 bottom performing schools being 5 of the top 7 schools for school spend per student.\n",
    " - Maths is the clear under performing department in District Schools - there is 16% average gap in pass rates between District & Charter Schools while there is a 27% gap in pass rates when comparing Maths results.\n",
    " - The size of schools appears to not have an impact on student results until it gets to >2000 students where there is a drop across the board.\n",
    " - Charter schools are generally smaller in both size and budget however produce far superior student results. "
